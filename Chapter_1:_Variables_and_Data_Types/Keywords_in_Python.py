# KEYWORDS IN PYTHON
# -----------------
# Keywords are reserved words in Python. They have special meaning and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language.
# Examples of keywords: and, else, in, return, as, except, is, True, assert, finally, etc.

# You cannot use keywords as variable names or identifiers.
# For example, 'true = 34' is incorrect because 'True' is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name.

# Keywords are reserved for specific functions or operations in Python.

# Python is case sensitive:
# There is a big difference between 'A' and 'a', or 'Apple' and 'apple'.
# For example, 'True' and 'true' are not the same. 'True' is a keyword, 'true' is not.
# Always use capital 'T' in 'True' and capital 'F' in 'False', otherwise you will get an error.

# You can see all Python keywords by using the 'keyword' module:
# import keyword
# print(keyword.kwlist)
