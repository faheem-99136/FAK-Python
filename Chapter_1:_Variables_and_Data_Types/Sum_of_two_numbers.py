# SUM OF TWO NUMBERS IN PYTHON
# ---------------------------
# To calculate the sum of two numbers, create two variables and assign values to them.

a = 3  # First number
b = 7  # Second number

# Create a third variable to store the sum of a and b
sum = a + b  # Adds a and b, stores the result in 'sum'

difference = a - b  # Subtracts b from a, stores the result in 'difference'

# Print the sum
print(sum)  # Output: 10

# You can also print the difference if needed
#print(difference)  # Output: -4

# This is a simple way to perform addition and subtraction in Python!
