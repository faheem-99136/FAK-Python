# Lets Practice:->
"""Write a program to check if a numberis multiple of 7 or not"""
# For example:
x = int(input("Enter the number: "))
if(x % 7 == 0):                      # 
    print("Multiple of 7")
else:
    print("Not a multiple.")   #


# Similarly we can try it for other numbers too just by replacing 7 with different number.
